Adds explaining tooltips querying their content from a MediaWiki installation, e.g. Wikipedia.org.

# Description

Adds explaining tooltips querying their content from a [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org "see MediaWiki docs") installation, e.g. [Wikipedia.org](https://www.wikipedia.org "see the well-known Wikipedia"). Therefore shortcodes can be used in Posts and Pages to mark keywords and link them to public Wiki pages. The well-known package of [Tooltipster](http://iamceege.github.io/tooltipster/ "Tooltipster rocks :)") is used to create the nice and themable tooltips.

Main features of the current version are:

* Setup the wanted Wiki base and several other options at a backend page
* Integrate the Wiki tooltip using shortcodes in Posts and Pages

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can I use any Wiki installation as base for my tooltips?

Sure, as long as the used installation provides an API structured like the [API of MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page "see API of MediaWiki") it will work perfectly. You can use one of the public Wikipedias or setup your own Wiki URL.

# Installation

1. Upload the Wiki tooltip plugin to your blog,
2. Activate it,
